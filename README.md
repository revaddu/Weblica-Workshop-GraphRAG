# Weblica-Workshop-GraphRAG

**Please stay tuned, we will post the details of our workshop shortly.**

In the meantime, you could start with some installation on your laptop that you will need on site - yes, it's a hands-on workshop!
So, for the start, please install Docker (and docker compose).
If you are on Mac, you can try some other free alternatives like Podman or Rancher Desktop.
